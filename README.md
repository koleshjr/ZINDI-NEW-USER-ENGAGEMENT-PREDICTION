# ZINDI-NEW-USER-ENGAGEMENT-PREDICTION

Zindi is nothing without its users

At Zindi, we understand that our users are the fuel that powers our rocket ship. To ensure we are always providing the best possible user experience, we want to know if users will return to Zindi in their second month after signing up. We believe that if a user is actively engaged from the start of their journey on Zindi, it means they are seeing value and will stick around. This is beneficial for both our platform and our users, as an active and healthy community means that we are adding value. 

The objective of this challenge is to predict if a new user from a selected cohort will continue to use Zindi in their second month. For example, if a user joined in June, will they be active in July? 

By helping us answer this question, you will be aiding us in establishing and tracking our performance as a data science community and platform, and making sure that we are best serving the needs of our users. Let's work together to make Zindi better for all!
